# Image Outpainting Model

A deep learning model for extending images beyond their original boundaries using GAN architecture with perceptual loss.

## Overview

This model implements image outpainting using a Generator-Discriminator architecture, allowing for seamless extension of images beyond their boundaries while maintaining visual consistency and realistic details.

## Features

- GAN-based architecture with Generator and Discriminator networks
- Perceptual loss for enhanced visual quality
- Weights & Biases (wandb) integration for experiment tracking
- Seamless blending between original and generated content
- Support for various image resolutions
- Configurable outpainting extent

## Requirements

```
torch>=1.8.0
torchvision>=0.9.0
wandb
numpy
Pillow
tqdm
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-outpainting
cd image-outpainting
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Architecture

### Generator
- Encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections
- Processes both image content and masked regions
- Outputs extended image regions matching the original image style

### Discriminator
- Patch-based discrimination for realistic local details
- Helps maintain consistency between original and generated regions

## Loss Functions

1. Adversarial Loss
   - Ensures realistic output generation
   - Uses binary cross-entropy loss

2. Perceptual Loss
   - VGG-based feature matching
   - Maintains semantic consistency

3. Reconstruction Loss
   - L1 loss for pixel-level accuracy
   - Ensures color and structure consistency

## Training

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset \
                --batch_size 32 \
                --epochs 100 \
                --lr 0.0002 \
                --wandb_project your_project_name
```

### Training Parameters
- Learning rate: 2e-4 (default)
- Batch size: 32 (default)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Beta1: 0.5, Beta2: 0.999

## Inference

```bash
python inference.py --input_image path/to/image.jpg \
                   --output_dir path/to/output \
                   --extension_ratio 0.5
```

## Weights & Biases Integration

The model uses wandb for experiment tracking, logging:
- Training/validation losses
- Generated samples
- Model architecture
- Training hyperparameters
- System metrics
